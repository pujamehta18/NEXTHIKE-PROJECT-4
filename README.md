In this project, we explore the task of predicting mobile phone prices based on various features. Our dataset includes information about mobile brands, ratings, RAM, ROM, and other relevant aspects.

 The goal is to build a scalable model that accurately estimates mobile prices. We employ techniques such as web scraping to collect data from e-commerce websites.

 The chosen regression techniques includeÂ Random Forest RegressionÂ andÂ Support Vector Regression. From data preprocessing to model deployment, this end-to-end project aims to provide valuable insights into mobile pricing during the lockdown period. ðŸ“±ðŸ’°
